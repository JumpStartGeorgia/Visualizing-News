        We Do Data Journalism!
        We Visualize News
        What is Data Journalism?
        Getting Data
        We seek out data from a variety of organizations, both public and private. When data is not readily available, we request it. When there is no data, we create it.
        Analyzing Data
        We look at the data from different angles, analyze it, see trends, observe proportion and relationships. We discover stories.
        Visualizing Data
        Visualization provides a unique perspective on data.
        We make information colourful  by visualizing stories using a variety of tools.
        We visualize each story using a tool that is better than others. The trick is to choose the right one.
        Share/Make it public
        We publish these visualizations on our website, make them freely available for others to use, share them with you, and hope you share them with others.
        45% more web users will click on a link if it features an infographic
        30% of those will forward it even if the information is pointless
        40 % of people respond better to visual information than text
        90 % of information that comes to the brain is visual

      meta_description: "Do you have data that you would like to see visualized, but do not have the time or skills? Share your data here! If it is interesting, there is a good chance someone will use it, which means you can then reuse their visualization. By sharing with the community, you are becoming part of something larger in which everyone involved benefits."
